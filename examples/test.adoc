Welcome to the InferenceQL tutorial.

WARNING: This functionality is very alpha.

You can select a whole table:

[,iql]
----
SELECT *
FROM satellites
----

You can also select a subset of the columns:

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Period_minutes,
  Purpose
FROM satellites
----

A subset of SQL queries are also valid InferenceQL.

Now here's a similar query with some custom InferenceQL logic!

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Period_minutes,
  Class_of_Orbit,

  PROBABILITY OF Period_minutes
  UNDER satellites_model
  GIVEN Class_of_Orbit
  AS prob
FROM satellites
ORDER BY prob ASC
----

== Generating data

[,iql]
----
SELECT
  Purpose,
  count(Purpose) AS count
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM
    GENERATE Purpose
    UNDER satellites_model
  LIMIT 1000
)
GROUP BY Purpose
ORDER BY count DESC
----
